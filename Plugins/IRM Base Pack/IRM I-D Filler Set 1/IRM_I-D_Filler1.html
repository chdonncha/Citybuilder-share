<h1 align="center">INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION MOD</h1>
<h2 align="center">I-D Filler Set 1</h2>
<hr>
<h3 align="center">1 - INTRODUCTION/OVERVIEW</h3>

<p>This is a set of <b>12 ploppable filler lots</b> for dirty industry (I-D) that can be used to complement grown industrial areas with some open yards, walls, and several types of cargo stacked outside. The set has been made for the <a href="http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/28268-industrial-revolution-mod-base-pack-maxis-lots/">IRM</a> and, as such, blends in well with I-D areas because it uses the same base texture, and the brick walls look good in connection with older brick factories and their side buildings.</p>

<p>You will find these lots in the landmark menu, conveniently grouped together. Names and descriptions are bilingual once again, i.e. if your SimCity installation has a German locale, you will automatically see German names and descriptions. All other locales will display English names and descriptions.</p>

<p>The lots with stacked cargo on them will be restricted to relatively level ground - after all, you wouldn't stack containers or pallets of cargo on an incline! The open areas and walls, however, are highly slope-tolerant, which makes them extremely versatile fillers.</p>

<p>Most props have been highly randomised. In some cases there is not only a random selection of the particular prop to appear, but also a certain probability wheter any prop will appear at all - or not. This has been made to maximise variation and visual interest.</p>

<p>When you have these lots on your mouse cursor, you will notice orange-coloured bars being displayed on them. These are <b>positioning indicators</b> that show the position and alignment of the most important props before you plop so there is no trial and error involved. Play around with it a bit, and I'm sure you'll find it to be self-explanatory. After plopping a lot, the positioning indicators will appear once for a second or so, and then disappear forever.</p>

<p>In terms of game stats, these lots are almost neutral. They do not contain any park/landmark effect, cause a negligible amount of pollution, and cost &sect;5 to plop/bulldoze each. There are no running costs whatsoever, so plopping a lot of these will not harm your budget even in the tiniest starter town.</p>

<p><b>INSTALLATION:</b> I recommend extracting the ZIP file into your main IRM folder (...\Plugins\IRM\). After installation, a new folder called "I-D Filler Set 1" should have appeared, which contains the 12 lot files you will need in order to use this set. However, there is no technical necessity to use this folder; any place inside your plugins will work.</p>

<hr>
<h3 align="center">2 - THE TECH STUFF</h3>

<p>Not much this time, since these are pretty plain eye-candy lots. As mentioned above, use with the <a href="http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/28268-industrial-revolution-mod-base-pack-maxis-lots/">IRM</a> is recommended and will yield best visual results, but there is no technical interdependency.</p>
</p>

<h3 align="center">3 - DEPENDENCIES</h3>
<p><b>If you use these lots as an extenstion of the IRM</b>, there will only be one additional dependency:<br>
<a href="http://kurier.simcityplaza.de/details.php?file=5">SFBT Essentials</a> - for the diagonal overlay, the barrier, and those nifty positioning indicators. This pack will be used on upcoming filler sets as well.</p>

<p><b>If you use these lots as a standalone set</b>, you will also have to download the following dependencies:<br>
<a href="http://sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=342">BSC Mega Props Jestarr Vol.01</a> - for most of the cargo props and some ancillary objects<br>
<a href="http://sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=338">BSC Mega Props Jestarr Vol.02</a> - some less important props<br>
<a href="http://sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=397">BSC Mega Props Gascooker Vol.01</a> - for the containers and a dumpster model I used.<br>
<a href="http://sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=2177">Rail Yard and Spur Textures Mega-Pak 1 Version 1.02</a> - for the base textures.<br></p>

<h3 align="center">4 - FINAL WORDS</h3>
<p>After so much growable stuff, I hope you will enjoy these ploppable fillers as well and find them useful to "dress up" grown industrial areas. Similar filler sets for manufacturing and high-tech industry are in the making.</p>
