<h2>Some Hints On How To Start A SPAM City</h2>

<p>There are two things you need to consider - </p>

<p><b>1)</b> this is not a small mod that changes a single aspect of 'something'... it is a large mod that changes a considerable part of game mechanics and behaviour;</p>

<p><b>2)</b> most of us are not used to play extended agricultural cities or regions... specially not of a type that <b>stays</b> agricultural &ndash; one of the main objectives of the SPAM.</p>

<p>So it will be necessary to 're-learn' how to play an agricultural setup (at least it was to us).</p>

<p>Do not plop the SPAM 'on top' of a more or less fully developed city and expect some sort of magical transformation... With SPAM you are supposed to (slowly) <b>develop</b> an agricultural area.</p>

<h3>Testing on a Developed City</h3>

<p>Of course you may still be the adventurous type who wants to just try this, testing out what might 'happen'... In that case we would recommend to take the whole SPAM folder (which normally resides under "PEGPROD"), move it to the root of your <i>Plugins</i> and rename it to 'zzz_SPAM' &ndash; that way you make sure it loads last (overriding other mods), and it will be easy to move it in and out of your <i>Plugins</i> to test and compare. Run your city for a while and observe. <b>Do not save the city until you are properly satisfied that no undesired developments occur</b>.</p>

<h3>Testing on a Virgin Tile</h3>

<p>To really understand and learn how to control the SPAM though, it might be better to start up a fresh tile and build up a new city... or even a fresh region &ndash; note that SPAM developments may happen at a very different pace depending on the neighborhood. Is it a 'virgin' region? Are there neighboring cities? How far have the neighbors developed? Are they connected with networks? Test as many different scenarios as possible...</p>

<p>With this approach it'll also be easy to test other custom farm lots you may have collected and still want to use &ndash; add them one-by-one to your <i>Plugins</i> and observe how they thrive... or if there are any conflicts.</p>

<p>Within a SPAM city you'll also notice vast changes, compared to a default start-up city. Settle in slowly - zone agriculture as you please, go easy on other types (RES and COM)... watch the curves of demand and capacities &ndash; they'll all behave differently from what you are used to. Same for civics, education, utilities and all the other things your Sims need or want or demand.</p>

<h2>Always remember...</h2>

<p>With the SPAM, agriculture is not anymore just a city-starter 'necessary evil' to be discarded once the ritzy neighborhoods develop &ndash; agriculture is now here to stay. Like we mentioned before - think of farm zoning more like low-density I-D and I-M that wants to be groomed and taken care of, instead of being replaced by concrete parking lots and highrise towers.</p>
