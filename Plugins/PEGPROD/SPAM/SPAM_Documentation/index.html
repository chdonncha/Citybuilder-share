<h2>What is this thing?</h2>

<p>The <b>S</b>im<b>P</b>eg <b>A</b>gricultural <b>M</b>od (<b>SPAM</b>) is an absolute, total and complete replacement for the game-default farming system.</p>

<p class="centered"><img src="img/spam-pre02.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt=""></p>

<p>The default system was never really finished before game release and was, in fact, designed to be short-lived and used only initially in starter cities. The game, as it progresses, actually is designed to kill off all desire and usefulness for farming.</p>

<p><b>We changed all that.</b></p>

<p>Not only have we changed how all the farms look... but we also changed how they play. Originally in a city, you could hug a tree... or kiss the sky with glass and steel. Now... you can do both.</p> 

<p>At its most basic function and goal, the SPAM is an <i>IND MTP Replacement Mod</i>... similar to the RES and COM MTP replacement mods. Its primary goal is to give an MTP-ish look and feel to the game's default farm lots.</p>

<p>Read on to find out more about the features and objectives of this mod.</p>
