<font class=SC4DP>SC4Mapper</font> is a compagnon utility of <a href="http://sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=731" target="_blank"><font color="blue">SC4Terraformer</font></a>. SC4Terraformer is <b>not</b> required to use SC4Mapper.<br>
It will help you to:
<li>Export a region you made in SC4
<li>Import a region that you have downloaded from STEX 
<li>Take an overview picture of your region ( usefull for planning or including in a CJ )

The <font class=SC4DP>2013 Version</font> comes with long waiting bug fixes and new features:
<li>Works on Vista,Win7 and even win8 
<li>Unicode fixes
<li>Zoom in/out for large regions
<li>Integrated config.bmp editor
<li>Best suitable config.bmp creation

Any operation should take less then 10 minutes, if SC4Mapper is doing nothing it certainly freezed and crashed<br/>
In that case, run the Debug version and post the output in the <a href="http://sc4devotion.com/forums/index.php?topic=15456.0">support thread</a><br/>

This is the main screen of <font class=SC4DP>SC4Mapper</font>.<br>
You can see the top bar buttons, where you can either
<li>Load a region from one you have in your SimCity 4 folder to export it
<li>Create a region from an external source file

<center>So let's load the San Fransisco region from SC4</center><br>
<center><img src="ScreenShot010.jpg"/></center>
<center>You'll have to wait while loading the whole region</center><br>
<center><img src="ScreenShot073.jpg"/></center>
And here is the SF region loaded, with the layout of the cities on top of it<br>
You see that you can scroll the window or enlarge it to get a better view<br>
<center><img src="ScreenShot062.jpg"/></center>
<center>You can also zoom in/out and hide the cities overlay</center><br>
You can also see that more buttons on top menu are now enable<br>
If you choose <b>Export region</b> you will be prompt for a destination file<br>
<center><img src="ScreenShot074.jpg"/></center><br>
So some explanations are needed here about the differents export formats
<li><b>SC4M</b> is the file format that was made for having a 0.1m precision when exporting the region in SC4Terraformer. The SC4M not only store the elevations of your region, but also store the config.bmp used, and can store a HTML file that will be display when another user will import it
<li><b>PNG</b> is the only 16 bit greyscale file format that can be read/write by Photoshop CS. This was originaly made for allow people to use image editors to edit the region.
<li><b>RGB</b> is a normal RGB format, exactly BMP, that store the elevation following a specific scheme. It was made to get around the limitation of the 16 bit png that only Photoshop CS can read/write.
<br><br>
If you choose to export as <b>SC4M</b>, you will be prompt for a HTML file that will be included into the SC4M and displayed to the user when importing.
<center><img src="ScreenShot076.jpg"/></center>
<center>You should enter an <b>existing</b> html file. or cancel to avoid including any html file</center>
<br>
If everything is ok, you should see the following messagebox
<center><img src="ScreenShot017.jpg"/></center>
<br><br>
Remember that the SC4M was specially designed to share your region at verious Exchanges.<br>
The format include the config.bmp, so no need to add it in your upload<br>
The format compress quite well, and when you will zip it to upload to any Exchange you won't see any gain<br>
The PNG and RGB export format are available for <i>authoring</i> usage as you can edit them in any image editor that support them.

When you click on <b>Create Region</b> you will be prompt to choose from what file format you want to import
<center><img src="ScreenShot018.jpg"/></center>
<center>The greyscale format is for creating a region from 8 bits greyscale image ( jpgs as found in the STEX )</center>
<br><br>
<li>If you choose to create a region from a SC4M
<center><img src="ScreenShot022.jpg"/></center>
You will be prompt for a SC4M file, and the region will be created ( you may have to wait few seconds in order to the application to generate to colors )<br/>
An HTML file might be displayed if included in the SC4M
<br>
<li>If you choose to create a region from Greyscale
<center><img src="ScreenShot023.jpg"/></center>
You will have to indicate the image file<br>
You can either specify a config.bmp or specify the size of the region in small city units, <b>in this case the region will include the most big cities it can, then medium and at last small cities</b><br>
<i>Note: </i>The size of the region will be automatically computed when you enter the picture or the config.bmp<br>
<i>Note: </i>You can change the region size to not match the picture file, in this case SC4Mapper will ask you to confirm<br>
<br>
As 8 bits pictures don't contain enougth information to represent a correct range of elevation, you can specify how much a change of 1 unit in grey will result in SC4
<center><img src="ScreenShot024.jpg"/></center>
<center><font class=SC4DP>SC4Mapper</font> includes the most commons factors used in terrain mods. See the description of the map you download to know which scale factor to use</center>
<center>You can also specify a real number instead of the predifined values</center>
<br><br>
Creating region from <b>16 bits png</b> or <b>RGB</b> pictures will follow the same process whitout the <b>scale factor</b> question.

Let's erase the whole last row of cities from the config

And now with CTRL and the down arrow key you can move the config overlay to get the exact region you want !!!
</center>

Of course you can move in any direction provided there is space to move !<br/>
<hr>
And you can even speed up the process by just getting a specific part !<br/>
<center><img width='800' src="ScreenShot059.jpg"/><br/>
By pressing CTRL and dragging around the cities you want
<img width='800' src="ScreenShot060.jpg"/><br/>

<center>This is the RGB file from one map I released in the NHP Islands Maps Pack 01</center>
<br>
The RGB scheme retains the 0.1m precision by using the following rules:
<li>the <b>blue</b> channel can increment by one unit, one unit increment represent 0.1m
<li>the <b>green</b> channel increment by 16 units, one 16 unit increment represent 25.6m
<li>the <b>red</b> channel increment by 16 units, one 16 unit increment represent 409.6m
